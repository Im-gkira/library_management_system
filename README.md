#  Library Management System

## Intro
Library Management system is a software which is developed to handle the basic tasks of a library. Today in most of the libraries records are maintained manually and thus it makes the current process cumbersome and hectic.

## Our Goal

Altough we build this application due to our acadmic curriculum but the main motivation/objective of the project to learn basics and concepts of flutter and firebase.

## What we created
So our library management app has two modules:
1 admin module
2 user module
We provided all the basic functionalities of a library management app in our app with a eye soothing UI/UX.
